				<h2>Ancient Era</h2>
				<h3>Abacus (2500 B.C.)</h3>
				<p>The first tool created specifically for use in mathematical 
					computations was the abacus, likely invented in Sumeria around 
					2500 B.C. The abacus was a table of successive columns with beads 
					or stones representing a single unit, which could be used for 
					addition or subtraction. Other cultures altered and refined the 
					abacus; the Chinese, for example, put beads on wire within a 
					bamboo frame to enhance ease of use. Unfortunately, the abacus was 
					not very useful for multiplication or division, necessitating the 
					invention of a new and more sophisticated device.

				<h3>Napier's Bones (1617)</h3>
				<p>In 1617 a Scottish mathematician John Napier published Rabdology, 
					or “calculation with rods.” In his writing, Napier described a 
					device that came to be known as Napier’s bones. The “bones” are 
					thin rods, which are inscribed with multiplication tables, and the 
					user determines their sum by changing the vertical alignment of 
					the rods, and horizontally reading the multiplication tables. 
					While these devices greatly assisted calculations, they were not 
					true “calculators,” merely assisting the person doing the mental 
					calculation.</p>

				<h3>Pascal's Calculator (1642)</h3>
				<p>In 1642, the first true “calculator” was invented: one that 
					performed calculations through a clockwork-type of mechanism. 
					The Pascal calculator, invented by French inventor and 
					mathematician Blaise Pascal, was lauded for attempting arithmetic 
					calculations previously thought impossible. But unfortunately, 
					they were difficult to produce and very few were ever made. The 
					mechanical calculator then invented by Thomas de Colmar in the 
					mid-nineteenth century, and subsequent others, were easier to 
					produce, but extremely large and bulky–not at all the pocket 
					calculators we know today.</p>

				<h3>Curta Calculator (1945)</h3>
				<p>Curt Herzstark invented the first handheld, mechanic calculator in 1945, 
					from a design he had created in 1938. Shaped like a stout pepper grinder, 
					the Curta calculators were produced in large quantities until the
					invention of digital calculator in 1970.</p>       
				<h3>The First Digital Pocket Calculator (1970)</h3>
				<p>In 1970, a company in Japan invented the first digital pocket calculator. 
					Companies in the United States, such as Texas Instruments, adapted the 
					design of the Japanese device, and enhanced it by creating the graphing 
					calculators we know today.</p>

				<h3>Calculator in Multiuse Devices</h3>
				<p>In the late 90s, the advancement of cell phone technology allowed 
					calculator to be added as an additional feature in cell phone. 
					Since then, individuals began to replace expensive digital calculators 
					with the multiuse device. This required even the most sophisticated 
					calculator designs to be upgraded in order to remain relevant in the 
					market.</p>
